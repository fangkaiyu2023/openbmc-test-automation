## Supported Systems Architecture

OpenBMC test infrastructure is proven capable of running on:

- POWER
- x86 systems running OpenBMC firmware stack.

## Testing Setup Steps

To verify the installation setup is completed and ready to execute.

- Download the openbmc-test-automation repository:
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc-test-automation
  $ cd openbmc-test-automation
  ```
- Execute basic setup test run:
  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx templates/test_openbmc_setup.robot
  ```
  where xx.xx.xx.xx is the BMC hostname or IP.

## Test Layout

There are several sub-directories within the openbmc-test-automation base which
contain test suites, tools, templates, etc. These sub-directories are classified
as follows:

`tests/`: Contains the general test cases for OpenBMC stack functional
verification. The "tests" subdirectory uses legacy REST and will be deprecated
at some point and therefore no longer supported.

`extended/`: Contains test cases for boot testing, code update testing using
legacy REST, etc.

`systest/`: Contains test cases for HTX bootme testing.

`xcat/`: Contains test cases for XCAT automation.

`gui/test/`: Contains test cases for testing web-based interface built on
AngularJS.

`gui/gui_test/`: Contains test cases for testing web-based user interface built
on Vue.js.

`pldm/`: Contains test cases for platform management subsystem (base, bios, fru,
platform, OEM).

`snmp/`: Contains test cases for SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
configuration testing.

`openpower/ras/`: Contains test cases for RAS (Reliability, Availability and
Serviceability) for an OpenPOWER system.

`openpower/secureboot/`: Contains test cases for secure boot testing on a secure
boot feature enabled OpenPOWER system only.

`tools/`: Contains various tools.

`templates/`: Contains sample code examples and setup testing.

`test_list/`: Contains the argument files used for skipping test cases (e.g
"skip_test", "skip_test_extended", etc.) or grouping them (e.g "HW_CI",
"CT_basic_run", etc.).

## Redfish Test Layout

OpenBMC is moving steadily towards DTMF Redfish, which is an open industry
standard specification and schema that meets the expectations of end users for
simple, modern and secure management of scalable platform hardware.

`redfish/`: Contains test cases for DMTF Redfish-related feature supported on
OpenBMC.

`redfish/extended/`: Contains test cases for combined legacy REST and DMTF
Redfish-related feature supported on OpenBMC.

Note: Work in progress test development parameter
`-v REDFISH_SUPPORT_TRANS_STATE:1` to force the test suites to execute in
redfish mode only.

## Quickstart

To run openbmc-automation first you need to install the prerequisite Python
packages which will help to invoke tests through tox (Note that tox version
2.3.1 or greater is required) or via Robot CLI command.

**Robot Command Line**

- Execute all test suites for `tests/`:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx  tests
  ```

- Execute a test suite:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:xx.xx.xx.xx redfish/extended/test_basic_ci.robot
  ```

- Initialize the following test variables which will be used during test
  execution:

  User can forward declare as environment variables:

  ```
  $ export OPENBMC_HOST=<openbmc machine IP address/hostname>
  $ export OPENBMC_USERNAME=<openbmc username>
  $ export OPENBMC_PASSWORD=<openbmc password>
  $ export IPMI_COMMAND=<Dbus/External>
  ```

  or

  User can input as robot variables as part of the CLI command:

  ```
  -v OPENBMC_HOST:<openbmc machine IP address/hostname>
  -v OPENBMC_USERNAME:<openbmc username>
  -v OPENBMC_PASSWORD:<openbmc password>
  ```

- For QEMU tests, set the following environment variables as well:

  ```
  $ export SSH_PORT=<ssh port number>
  $ export HTTPS_PORT=<https port number>
  ```

- Run tests:

  ```
  $ tox tests
  ```

- How to run individual test:

  One specific test:

  ```
  $ tox -e default -- --include Power_On_Test  tests/test_basic_poweron.robot
  ```

  No preset environment variables, default configuration for all supported
  systems:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- tests
  ```

  No preset environment variables, one test case from a test suite:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- --include Power_On_Test tests/test_basic_poweron.robot
  ```

  No preset environment variables, the entire test suite:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- tests
  ```

  No preset environment variables, the entire test suite excluding test cases
  using argument file:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/skip_test tests
  ```

  Exclude test list for supported systems:

  ```
  Palmetto:  test_lists/skip_test_palmetto
  Witherspoon:  test_lists/skip_test_witherspoon
  ```

- Run IPMI tests:

  Running only out-of-band IPMI tests:

  ```
  $ robot -v IPMI_COMMAND:External -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x --argumentfile test_lists/witherspoon/skip_inband_ipmi tests/ipmi/
  ```

  Running only inband IPMI tests:

  ```
  $ robot -v IPMI_COMMAND:Inband -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x -v OS_HOST:x.x.x.x -v OS_USERNAME:xxxx -v OS_PASSWORD:xxxx --argumentfile test_lists/witherspoon/skip_oob_ipmi tests/ipmi/
  ```

- Run GUI tests:

  By default, GUI runs with Firefox browser and headless mode. Example with
  chrome browser and header mode:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x -v GUI_BROWSER:gc -v GUI_MODE:header gui/test/
  ```

  Run GUI default CI test bucket:

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x --argumentfile test_lists/BMC_WEB_CI gui/test/
  ```

- Run LDAP tests:

  Before using LDAP test functions, be sure appropriate LDAP user(s) and
  group(s) have been created on your LDAP server. Note: There are multiple ways
  to create LDAP users / groups and all depend on your LDAP server. One common
  way for openldap is ldapadd / ldapmodify refer
  https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapadd For ldapsearch, refer to
  "https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch". Microsoft ADS: refer to
  https://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Microsoft-Active-Directory-Domain-Services-AD-DS

  Note: Currently, LDAP test automation for Redfish API is in progress. The
  format to invoke LDAP test is as follows:

  ```
  $ cd redfish/account_service/
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x -v LDAP_SERVER_URI:<ldap(s)//LDAP Hostname / IP> -v LDAP_BIND_DN:<LDAP Bind DN> -v LDAP_BASE_DN:<LDAP Base DN> -v LDAP_BIND_DN_PASSWORD:<LDAP Bind password> -v LDAP_SEARCH_SCOPE:<LDAP search scope> -v LDAP_SERVER_TYPE:<LDAP server type> -v LDAP_USER:<LDAP user-id> -v LDAP_USER_PASSWORD:<LDAP PASSWORD> -v GROUP_NAME:<Group Name> -v GROUP_PRIVILEGE:<Privilege>  ./test_ldap_configuration.robot
  ```

- How to run CI and CT bucket test:

  Default CI test bucket list:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/HW_CI tests
  ```

  Default CI smoke test bucket list:

  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/CT_basic_run tests
  ```

- Run extended tests:

  For-loop test (default iteration is 10):

  ```
  $ robot -v OPENBMC_HOST:x.x.x.x -v OPENBMC_SYSTEMMODEL:xxxxxx -v ITERATION:n -v LOOP_TEST_COMMAND:xxxxxx extended/full_suite_regression.robot
  ```

  Example using tox testing a test suite for 5 iterations "witherspoon":

  ```
  OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x  LOOP_TEST_COMMAND="tests/test_fw_version.robot" ITERATION=5 OPENBMC_SYSTEMMODEL=witherspoon tox -e witherspoon -- ./extended/full_suite_regression.robot
  ```

- Host CPU architecture

  By default openbmc-test-automation framework assumes that host CPU is based on
  the POWER architecture. If your host CPU is x86 add
  `-v PLATFORM_ARCH_TYPE:x86` variable setting to your CLI commands or set an
  environment variable:

  ```
  $ export PLATFORM_ARCH_TYPE=x86
  ```

**Jenkins jobs tox commands**

- HW CI tox command:
  ```
  $ OPENBMC_HOST=x.x.x.x tox -e default -- --argumentfile test_lists/HW_CI tests
  ```
